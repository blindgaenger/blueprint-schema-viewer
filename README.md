# blueprint-schema-viewer

Renders the Data Structures of an API Blueprint into a viewable HTML file.

BEWARE: This is just a quick and dirty implementation. Therefore it's not
tested at all and lacks features, but it fits my needs. If you find it useful
anyway, than create an issue or drop me a line.
